
Running Application

To Run this application you will need a few things first.  First you will need to download and
install node on your machine or run the portable version.  I ran my project from netbeans
because I feel this editor makes it easier to work with node servers.  I installed Node on
my machine to make it easier to work with while developing.  Instructions on how to install node
can be found here. http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows

Once you have Node installed or the portable version downloaded.  You can do npm install of the packages.json 
file in the rout of the project.  This will create the node_modules folder where everything that npm install will be 
placed.

Mongo DB will also be required to run this application and the portable version can be downloaded from. https://www.mongodb.com/ 
Once you have download you can run the portable version so that the database is running before you run your the applicatinion.

Start the Server
Run the Command line or if in netbeans run the server_start file with node to start the server for the application.
Go to localhost:3000 and the site should then come up.
